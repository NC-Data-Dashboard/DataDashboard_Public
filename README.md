### Folder Breakdown
Each folder in main directory will have the following:
* Backups
  * Here the data from the previous update will be saved until the next update.
* Notebooks
  * The Jupyter Notebooks upon which the Python scripts are based are located here.
    * Note: They may not match their respective Python script.  If this is case, open ‘command prompt’, navigate to the notebook folder, and run ‘jupyter nbconvert  --to script [notebook].ipynb’
	  * If you want to convert all the notebooks to .py scripts use asterisk (*) instead of the notebook name
* Scripts
  * Python Scripts that the .bat file runs are located here.  After converting notebooks to .py files, move .py files here.
* Updates
  * The data that was pulled from the latest update will be here, waiting to be uploaded to the database.
  
Some folders will have a Data folder for data in .csv form that could not be pulled using web address.

All folders contain or will contain Windows Batch Files (.bat) to simplify and expedite update process.
