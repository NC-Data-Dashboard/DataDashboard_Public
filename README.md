# Welcome!

## __DataDashboard__
This folder contains work I created related to the Junior Data Analyst role at Western Carolina University.  I am in charge of updating Land data and Earnings data for the [NC Data Dashboard](https://www.wcu.edu/engage/regional-development/data-dashboard.aspx).  

### __Land__
The Land folder contains Python scripts that can be used to pull data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) and [GeoFRED](https://geofred.stlouisfed.org/map/).

### __GeoFRED__
The GeoFRED folder includes scipts to pull all 'maps' of data currently being used by the Data Dashboard, minus those used for Land data.

### __Earnings__
The Earnings folder is still a work in progress, but will eventually contain similar scripts.

#### __Notes__
All folders contain or will contain Windows Batch Files to simplify and expedite update process.
