# Welcome to the NC Data Dashboard!
This repository contains work I created as it relates to the Junior Data Analyst role at Western Carolina University.  I am in charge of updating both Land and Earnings data for the [NC Data Dashboard](https://www.wcu.edu/engage/regional-development/data-dashboard.aspx).  
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Main Folders
### [Land](https://github.com/grumpyphotographer/NCDataDashboard/tree/master/Land)
The Land folder contains Python scripts that can be used to pull data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) and [GeoFRED](https://geofred.stlouisfed.org/map/).

### [GeoFRED](https://github.com/grumpyphotographer/NCDataDashboard/tree/master/GeoFRED)
The GeoFRED folder includes scipts to pull all 'maps' of data currently being used by the Data Dashboard, minus those used for Land data.

### [Earnings](https://github.com/grumpyphotographer/NCDataDashboard/tree/master/Earnings)
The Earnings folder is still a work in progress, but will eventually contain similar scripts.

### Folder Breakdown
Each folder will have the following:
* Backups
  * Here the data from the previous update will be saved until the next update.
* Notebooks
  * The Jupyter Notebooks upon which the Python scripts are based are located here. 
    * Note: They may not match their respective Python script.  If that is the case, please let me know so I can fix it!
* Scripts
  * Python Scripts that the .bat file runs are located here.
* Updates
  * The data that was pulled from the latest update will be here, waiting to be moved to the Dashboard.
  
All folders contain or will contain Windows Batch Files to simplify and expedite update process.
