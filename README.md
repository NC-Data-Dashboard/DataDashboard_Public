# Welcome!

### DataDashboard
This folder contains work I created related to the Junior Data Analyst role at Western Carolina University.  I am in charge of updating Land data and Earnings data for the [NC Data Dashboard](https://www.wcu.edu/engage/regional-development/data-dashboard.aspx). In the Land folder, there are Python scripts that can be used to pull data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/).  These can be run using command line or Python IDE.  The notebooks are located in the Notebooks folder  The Earnings folder is still a work in progress, but will eventually contain similar scripts.
